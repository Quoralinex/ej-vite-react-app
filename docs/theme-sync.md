# Cloudflare Project Theme Sync Mapping

This repository does not include information about the nine Cloudflare projects requested for theme synchronization (e.g., project names, deployment URLs, or linked repositories). Without access to the Cloudflare dashboard or project-specific documentation, the mapping cannot be confirmed.

## Requested Mapping Fields
For each project, the following details are needed:
- Cloudflare project name
- Production URL
- GitHub repository (OWNER/REPO)
- Framework (Astro, Vite, Remix, etc.)
- Location of the `<head>` definition (file path)
- Location of the header/toggle component (file path)

## Status
- **Current state:** Required project metadata is not present in this repository, and Cloudflare dashboard access is needed to retrieve the mappings.
- **Next steps:** Once project names or dashboard access are provided, fill in the table below.
